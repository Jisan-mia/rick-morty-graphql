## Rick And Morty GraphQL App

This is a client application which consumes the Rick and Morty GraphQL API.

I've used [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) to generate type definitions automatically.

A feature based folder structure has been implemented to keep things organized.

**Live demo is [here](https://gql-rm.jisan.io/)**.

## Technologies Used:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Development

First, we need to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

And run the project in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## The Rick and Morty API

This is a really cool public API which provides you the characters, locations and episodes. It has both Rest and GraphQL implementations. So, you can use it to learn and explore new techniques, libraries etc.
